7
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.500
One of the key features of the MBA program at

8
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.700
TCNJ is the strategy Innovation and

9
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.400
Leadership specialization.

This specialization is designed for mid-career professionals

11

who want to explore three key components

12
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.400
of management that ultimately will lead to

13
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.900
innovative ideas products and companies. That

14
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.500
is NJ MBA program teaches me a lot of Concepts that

15
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.500
I learned in class. Then I use it for my clients

16
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.200
and teach them things. I just learned that same day. So it's

17
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.400
amazing that get to learn it and apply it within real time.

18
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.100
Strategy Innovation and leadership are critical

19
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.800
in business.

20
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.100
Strategy enables you to understand the environment detect

21
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.800
opportunities and formulate approaches

22
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.100
Innovation such as

23
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.200
for the possible for the different for what does

24
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.100
not yet exist.

25
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.800
Finally leadership is action being

26
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.800
a great leader requires understanding and a

27
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.300
desire to direct others with commitment and

28
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.500
integrity. I chose strategy Innovation

29
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.900
and Leadership because I want to move

30
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.700
my career to that next level.

31
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.700

32
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.600

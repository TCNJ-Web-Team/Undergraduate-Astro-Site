00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.500
I'm always excited when I see
an application from a TCNJ

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:04.980
grad come across my desk.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.880
I know the effort that the college puts

4
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.060
in preparing students to enter
the workforce, specifically educators.

5
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.420
As an alum myself,
I remember the long period of time I spent

6
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.060
preparing for this,
and I'm seeing that work ethic is still

7
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.180
coming out of the students
coming out of TCNJ.

8
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.380
Those students are collaborative,
they're innovative,

9
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.380
they're creative.

10
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.440
They're willing to jump in and to try
things new in our classrooms.

11
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.140
They're not afraid of technology.

12
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.540
All of the things that we look
for in our future educators.

13
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.580
So any time I get an opportunity to hire

14
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.320
a graduate from this campus,
I'll jump on that opportunity.

in a program

9
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.600
today's organizations are generating an enormous

10
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.000
amount of data. They're also purchasing a lot

11
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.500
of data and they really don't know what to do with it. So we

12
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.200
need data scientists to help them figure out

13
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.200
how to take this data and turn it into insights.

14
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.500

17
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.400
they need someone to help them navigate the waters

and make the right decisions.
